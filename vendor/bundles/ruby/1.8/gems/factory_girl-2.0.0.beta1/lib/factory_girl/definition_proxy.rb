    # Adds an attribute that should be assigned on generated instances for this
    # factory.
    #
    # This method should be called with either a value or block, but not both. If
    # called with a block, the attribute will be generated "lazily," whenever an
    # instance is generated. Lazy attribute blocks will not be called if that
    # attribute is overridden for a specific instance.

    # When defining lazy attributes, an instance of FactoryGirl::Proxy will
    # be yielded, allowing associations to be built using the correct build
    # strategy.
    #
    # Arguments:
    # * name: +Symbol+ or +String+
    #   The name of this attribute. This will be assigned using :"#{name}=" for

    # Adds an attribute that builds an association. The associated instance will
    # be built using the same build strategy as the parent instance.
    #
    # Example:
    #   factory :user do

    #   end
    #

    #     association :author, :factory => :user

    #   The name of this attribute.
    # * options: +Hash+

    # * factory: +Symbol+ or +String+
    #    The name of the factory to use when building the associated instance.
    #    If no name is given, the name of the attribute is assumed to be the
    #    name of the factory. For example, a "user" association will by
    #    default use the "user" factory.

    # Registers an alias for this factory using the given name.
    #
    # Arguments:
    # * name: +Symbol+
    #   The name of the alias.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   factory :user do
    #     aliased_as :author
    #   end
    #
    #   Factory(:author).class
    #   # => User
    #
    # Because an attribute defined without a value or block will build an
    # association with the same name, this allows associations to be defined
    # without factories, such as:
    #
    #   factory :user do
    #     aliased_as :author
    #   end
    #
    #   factory :post do
